        Hello, my name is Allen Keeling, I use male pronouns for myself but as long as I know you're referring to me you got them right.

    <h2>
        How I spend my time <del> obviously not doing work, seriously my attention span has had hands this week, I don't even know if I'll be able to finish this </del>
    </h2>
    <p>
        I don't have a ton of hobbies but I need to change that. I spend most of my time studying, which is really funny since I'm so bad at homework. 
        Ya see I'm only good at studying when I'm particularly interested in something which changes rapidly. I have a bunch of youtube channels I'm
        subscribed to which main purpose is to make studying fun and it usually works with me, though the main topic I study is geography because of
        the games I play like Europa universalis 4.

        My coding story
    </h3>
    <p>
        I've always been interested in stem topics. I can retain a lot of trivia for memorization based research like geography but it's hard to make
        use of that. Whereas I've always been a bit more naturally able to handle math and science. So when I graduated highschool I already knew my general
        path but wasn't very down on specifics, because of some personal situation I didn't feel able to go to college out of highschool.
        I found programming the easiest skill for me to pick up at the time so I started applying to software jobs on a whim but nothing really came of it.
        There wasn't much of a change until june 2023 when holberton had a <del> booth? </del> <ins> stand </ins> at the pride parade I went to, and things started
        happening pretty naturally. I don't have any specific tie to full stack, I'll probably do a variety of jobs given the chance but while studying whatever I
        want I figured I should probably be in the course that'd help me get a job the easiest. That's not to say I don't like full stack just not particularly more
        than any of the other options.
